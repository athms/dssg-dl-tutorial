# A quick introduction to the basics of deep learning

This repository contains materials for a quick introductory course on the basics of deep learning for the participants of the [data science for social good summer program](https://datascience.stanford.edu/programs/data-science-social-good-summer-program) of Stanford Data Science.


## 1. Running the notebooks

For a general introduction to the Jupyter environment, I recommend [this tutorial](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/).

You can either run the Jupyter notebooks locally on your personal computer or remotely with [Jupyter Binder](https://mybinder.org) using the following link:  https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/athms/dssg-dl-tutorial/HEAD
